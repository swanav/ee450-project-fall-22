***What you have done in the assignment, if you have completed the optional part (suffix). If itâ€™s not mentioned, it will not be considered.***

> **The assignment contains all the features described in the assignment description, including the `optional` part of the assignment.**

1. Implemented a backend server, `serverC` which receives authentication requests over **UDP** from the frontend server, serverM and responds with the appropriate authentication status after matching the credentials from a encrypted csv database, `cred.txt`.
2. Implemented backend servers, `serverCS` and `serverEE`, which receives course lookup requests over **UDP** from the frontend server, serverM and responds with the appropriate course data from a csv database, `cs.txt` and `ee.txt`.
3. Implemented a frontend server, `serverM` which talks to the backend servers mentioned above over **UDP** and interfaces with the client application over **TCP**. Handles authentication and course information lookup requests. It also aggregates course lookup requests for multiple requests to respond to a bulk query.
4. Implements a `client`, which talks to the frontend server, `serverM` and provides the user an interface to authenticate themselves and request information regarding courses.

> This implementation contains extensive use of function pointers and macros to reduce code duplication and increase readability. Socket functionalities (TCP and UDP) have been carefully encapsulated in separate `networking.[ch]` files. The servers and the client reuse the same codebase to communicate over TCP and UDP. Please note that in accordance to the project guidelines, it is ***only the code that is being reused***. The applications themselves do not share any runtime and operate in ***complete isolation***. Where possible, the code employs macro guards to make it easy to understand which functions are accessible to which applications.

> Similarly, since the `serverCS` and `serverEE` provide the same functionality to the user. `department_server.[ch]` implements the core functionality and both the department servers are implemented as wrappers around it. This allows for easy addition of new departments in the future without code duplication.

> I had started this implementation to serve multiple clients at the same time, but didn't after clarifications received on class forum and time constraints. The codebase is structured to support this feature in the future with minimal changes.

***The format of all the messages exchanged.***

The `protocol.c` contains all the message formats and the functions to serialize and deserialize them.

All the exchanged messages are in the format:

```
| < -------------- Protocol Header -------------- > | < Payload > |
|     Type     |     Flags     | Message Length (N) |   Message   |
| <  1 byte  > | <  1 byte   > | <     2 bytes    > | < N bytes > |
```

`Type` can be any of the following depending on the transaction.

- `0x61 - REQUEST_TYPE_AUTH`
- `0x62 - REQUEST_TYPE_COURSES_SINGLE_LOOKUP`
- `0x63 - REQUEST_TYPE_COURSES_MULTI_LOOKUP`
- `0x64 - REQUEST_TYPE_COURSES_DETAIL_LOOKUP`
- `0x71 - RESPONSE_TYPE_AUTH`
- `0x72 - RESPONSE_TYPE_COURSES_SINGLE_LOOKUP`
- `0x73 - RESPONSE_TYPE_COURSES_MULTI_LOOKUP`
- `0x74 - RESPONSE_TYPE_COURSES_DETAIL_LOOKUP`
- `0x75 - RESPONSE_TYPE_COURSES_ERROR`

`Flags` contains the flags for the message. It varies depending on the transaction.

`Length` contains the length of the message. `16 bits` allows it support messages with lengths upto 65536. The payload however cannot exceed `1024 - 4 = 1020` bytes (A limit that can be changed in `constants.h`).

`Message` contains the payload of the message.

***Any idiosyncrasy of your project. It should say under what conditions the project fails, if any.***

1. This code does not handle the possibility of multiple clients to serverM properly. Although, serverM will be able to accept multiple connections, it will be able to exchange messages with the most recent client at a time. 
2. This code also does not serve two queries at the same time. If a client sends a query, it will be served, and only then will a client be able to send another query.

-----
***Reused Code: Did you use code from anywhere for your project? If not, say so. If so, say what functions and where they're from. (Also identify this with a comment in the source code.)***

The code takes inspirations from the socket programming guide at [beej.us](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/). Although, none of the snippets have been copied directly. 

Also some of the utility functions for string manipulation and csv handling are implemented after taking reference from Stack Overflow.
